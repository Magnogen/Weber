# Weber
Weber is a programming language that compiles to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It's indentation based, so you don't need to worry about things like closing tags and stuff like you usually would with HTML.

I'll let you know how I get on with it once I'm out of Alpha development! (It'll be soon!)
